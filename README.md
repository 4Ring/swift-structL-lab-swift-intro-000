## Learning Objectives

* Complete this lab

## Outline / Notes

*  I've included the .xcworkspace file which includes both Quick & Nimble. 
* This I'm leaving pretty open-ended. I think shey should get familiar with creating various structs. 
* Maybe we ask them to create 4-5 different structs, each of which has their own various functions, some mutating, some not.
* I've included an example in Xcode which you can check out.
